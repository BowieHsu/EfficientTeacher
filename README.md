Hello everyone, this is the repository for our semi-supervised object detection work, Efficient Teacher, developed specifically for YOLOv5. 

We are currently undergoing internal open source procedures and hope to be able to meet with everyone soon. Here is our paper on this work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07577. 

Our experiments have shown that under a well-tuned set of hyperparameters, Efficient Teacher can help developers improve the performance of their detectors by utilizing a large amount of unlabeled real-world scenario data.
